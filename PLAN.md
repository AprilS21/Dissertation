# Plan

Below is the current plan for my dissertation. 

This is still provisional as some areas might require more time than I have allotted. 

---

- Background Research (Finish by end of November)
   - This includes researching the functionality of GAEN Covid tracking apps DONE
   - How the GAEN keys are generated 

- Research into how to analyse randomness (Begin near end November, finish by end of December)
   - This includes researching the methods commonly used to test encryption and randomness
   - Perhaps will speak to a statistician
   - Also investigate the keys and how to access them

- Write code (January)
   - I need to write code to carry out the tests from above

 - Write up (March)
    - finalise work
    - write my findings in my report

### Tests I will carry out

- Dieharder
   - working provisionally
- NIST
   - need to investigate how to run it
- Boolean functions
   - paper does not provide the code used, further investigation required
- Spectral test
   - working on it, using r
- other distribution analysis
   - needs investigation, will probably use r
- Hardamad transform
   - needs investigating
- bias test
   - if I have time
