\section{Chosen Tests}

\subsection{Test Suites}

The NIST and Dieharder test suites were chosen to evaluate the GAEN keys. 

(May not be used because it wants streams of random numbers as input) NIST is widely used in industry~(\cite{9209663})~(\cite{9232553})~(\cite{6236554}) and is accepted as a standard. It contains tests that are recommended by NIST for the evaluation of PRNGs used in cryptography. \par

Dieharder ?

\subsection{Other Tests}

Some tests outside of the test suites were performed. These include chi-squared test, lagplot and hilbert curve. 
The counts of the numbers of 1s and 0s in each bit position were also recorded and this data was plotted to allow for quick inspection. \par

This is a non-exhaustive list of possible tests. There are endless tests that can be ran to build confidence that the keys are random, however it is never certain if the data is truly random or not.
